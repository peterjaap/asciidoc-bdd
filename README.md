# Asciidoc Book Driven Development CLI tool

## Who is this for?
This is for book authors who are writing a technical book and want a Github repository for their readers to work along with.

## What does it do?
This tool can read your book (in its Asciidoc source format) and extract file includes according to a certain regex. For instance, you could configure it to extract all PHP files in a certain directory. It can then build up a Github repo using tags and commits. The repository can be rebuilt from the ground up, ensuring a logical processing through the tags.

## Credits
Inspired by Fabien Potencier, who talked about _Book Driven Development_ in his book: Symfony 5 - The Fast Track. You can check out his Github repo for the book here: https://github.com/the-fast-track/book-5.0-1
